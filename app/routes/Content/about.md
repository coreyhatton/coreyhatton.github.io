Then you’ve come to the right place – so let’s get to know each other a bit better!</p><p>As a freelance content writer and strategist based in Perth, WA and working with businesses big and small across Australia, I’m here to help you connect with your customers today.</p></div>

## There’s three main reasons why I started freelancing as a content marketing pro:

- I think like a marketer, but I write like a writer. That means that no matter the piece I’m writing, from that catchy bit of SEO-optimised web content to the most basic of product copywriting, people always come first. Converting readers to customers is no easy feat – but it gets a whole lot easier when they’re engaged with relevant, informative content tailored to their unique needs.

- Communication and transparency are core values of every project I work on. I believe that proactive communication and transparency are integral to creating successful content for successful businesses. Whether it’s tailor-made content briefs or unlimited rewrites until you’re 100% satisfied with the work before we publish, I make sure that every step of the project lifecycle lives and breathes collaboration and co-creation.

- I understand what goes in and what comes out of your business planning. I’ve worked on both sides of the marketing equation – from in-house communications teams to agency-side consulting, I’ve got the knowledge and skills to provide quality content that audiences want to read, and businesses want to show.

My journey took me from publishing my honours thesis on customer-business value co-creation to diving head-first into the corporate world – both in-house and as a consultant.</p><p> Working with small and medium businesses, as well as a few of the industry heavyweights along the way, has given me a myriad of skills and knowledge that I include in my content marketing services wherever I can.
